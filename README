=============================

Hi, I'm Alex! This is my personal website.

The site makes use of the jQuery Backstretch plugin 
from Scott Robbin. http://srobbin.com/blog/jquery-plugins/jquery-backstretch/

=============================

This simple three-page website is designed to look like a basic squarespace designed website, but using Jekyll and free. Hopefully the code isn't too shitty.

Love,
Me
